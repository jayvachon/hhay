Conversations in america typically begin with a familiar exchange:

"Hi, how are you?"

"I'm good, how are you?"

"Good, thanks"

< begin actual conversation >

(and variations thereof)

this is the cultural norm and virtually all conversations (especially between strangers and loved ones) are initiated this way.

what affect does this have on us? By adulthood, the words roll off the tongue so quickly as to barely be perceived. The "Hi how are you" ritual is so engrained and so trite that to actually engage the question is taboo. 

this is harmful - and the harm goes far beyond "fake friendliness." "Hi how are you" is the real american pledge of allegiance - participating reaffirms the notion that individuals are responsible for their own emotional needs AND reinforces the (false) connection between happiness and success

To this end, "Hi how are you" actually accomplishes the exact opposite of what it purports to. rather than being a sincere "check in", "Hi how are you" contracts the participants to NOT engage on an emotional level (if you're feeling down it probably means you're not working hard enough at feeling good)

as a means of limiting honest connection between two people, this is a terrible practice. but it has even larger implications for american society as a whole. in the course of a day, the typical american will invoke "Hi how are you" with nearly everyone they encounter - no relationship is immune. partners, spouses, children, parents, friends, cashiers, colleagues, restaurant servers, bartenders, strangers on the street... there is literally no relationship that cannot incorporate "Hi how are you."

what this results in is not just an emotionally repressed society, but a society that VALUES emotional repression. sincerely expressing yourself (being vulnerable) -especially when that expression is "negative" (sadness, e.g.)- is inextricably tied to labor capacity. happy people not only perform better work, but reinforce the notion that the work is WORTH DOING. unhappiness reminds us that Meaning is much more illusory than we'd like it to be

but of course repression doesn't make the feelings go away. it only amplifies them. and when (healthy, important) feelings of unhappiness, dissatisfaction, etc. are not released, they develop into more intense and dangerous feelings of anger and spite. these are the feelings we need to worry about, because they have the potential to turn violent - a potential we see manifested all too often through mass shootings, domestic abuse, rape, etc. when an individual feels as though they can't connect emotionally with anyone, they lash out at everyone.

we need to fix this.

with a problem this big, there's obviously not going to be an immediate or easy solution, but we should begin by acknowledging and talking (emotionally!) about the problem. it might be helpful to recognize that in the busyness of our daily lives it's often not possible to have a deep emotional connection with every stranger we encounter. it's ok not to say "Hi how are you" - especially if you don't intend to listen to the answer.

let's remove the "Hi" from "Hi how are you." let's recognize the value in all emotions - that it's healthy to sometimes feel sad, or at least not "good" or "fine." that Negative emotions possess a huge potential for Real Human Connection and relief. that if all of us are always GOOD then there's no impetus to adjust or outright change our situation.

now, with all this in mind, ask yourself: how am i feeling? once you've figured it out, find someone, give them a hug, and tell them!
