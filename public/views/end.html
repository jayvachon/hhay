				<h1>Thank you for playing</h1>
				<p>Virtually all conversations in America begin with some variation of this familiar exchange:</p>
				<p>STEPHANIE: Hi, how are you?</p>
				<p>STEPHEN: I'm good, how are you?</p>
				<p>STEPHANIE: Good, thanks.</p>
				<p><begin actual conversation></p>
				<p>What affect does this have on us? By adulthood, the words roll off the tongue so quickly as to barely be perceived. The "Hi, how are you?" ritual is so ingrained and so trite that to actually engage the question is taboo.</p>
				<p>This is harmful - and the harm goes far beyond "fake friendliness." "Hi, how are you?" is the real American Pledge of Allegiance. Participating reinforces both the notion that individuals are responsible for their own emotional needs AND the connection between happiness and success (there is a reason our default is "good" and not "ok," which is probably a more accurate baseline).</p>
				<p>To this end, "Hi, how are you?" actually accomplishes the exact opposite of what it purports to. Rather than being a sincere check-in, "Hi, how are you?" contracts the participants to NOT engage on an emotional level. What more is there to talk about if both people are feeling "good?"</p>
				<p>Within a single conversation, this is a terrible practice. But it has even larger implications for the American society as a whole. in the course of a day, the typical American will invoke "Hi, how are you?" with nearly everyone they encounter. No relationship is immune. Partners, spouses, children, parents, friends, cashiers, customers, collegeagues, restaraunt servers, bartenders, strangers on the street... literally every relationship can incorporate "Hi, how are you?"</p>
				<p>What this results in is not just an emotionally repressed society, but a society that VALUES emotional repression. Sincerely expressing yourself (being "vulnerable") - especially when that expression is "negative" (sadness, e.g.) - is inextricably tied to labor capacity. People perform better work when they're happy, and they're happy when they feel like their work is WORTH DOING. Unhappiness reminds us that Meaning is much more illusory than we'd like it to be, and that it might exist outside of labor.</p>
				<p>But of course repression doesn't make the feelings go away. It only omplifies them. And when (healthy, important) feelings of unhappiness, dissatisfaction, etc. are not released, they develop into more intense and volatile feelings of anger and spite. These are the feelings we need to worry about, because they have the potential to turn violent - a potential we see manifested all too often through mass shootings, domestic abuse, rape, racism, etc. When an individual feels as though they can't connect with anyone, they lash out at everyone.</p>
				<p>We can fix this.</p>
				<p>With a problem this big, there's obviously not going to be an immediate or easy solution, but we could begin by acknowledging and talking (emotionally!) about the problem. It might be helpful to recognize that in the busyness of our daily lives it's often not possible to have a deep emotional connection with every stranger we encounter. It's ok not to say "Hi, how are you?" - especially if you don't intend to listen to the answer.</p>
				<p>Let's remove the "Hi" from "Hi, how are you?" Let's recognize the value in ALL emotions - that it's healthy to sometimes feel sad. That Negative emtions possess enormous potential for Real Human Connection and relief, if only they are expressed. That if all of us are always GOOD then there's not impetus to adjust or outright change our situation</p>
				<p>So ask yourself: How am I feeling? When you've figured it out, find someone and tell them! They've probably felt that way before, too.</p>
